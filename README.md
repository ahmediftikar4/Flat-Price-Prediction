# Flat-Price-Prediction
This repo predicts the Sale Price of a flat/apartment using machine Learning algorithm 'XGBOOST'.
XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way.
